For the phpfpm_status plugin, you'll need to enable the status feature included in newer version of PHP-FPM. Jérôme 
Loyet from the Nginx forums provided some useful insight on how to get this working with Nginx. You'll essentially set 
up the status location directive like this:

location ~ ^/(status|ping)$ {
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass backend;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $fastcgi_script_name;
    allow 127.0.0.1:9000;
    allow stats_collector.localdomain;
    allow watchdog.localdomain;
    deny all;
}

Note: The phpfpm_status plugin is particularly useful if you're using dynamic process management. You can choose static or dynamic in the php5-fpm.conf.
